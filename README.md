# node-dump-stacks

A node native module (NaN) which watches the node event loop for blockages.
When a blockage is observed, it prints the javascript stack. This gives you a
chance to diagnose what's gone wrong.


## What does it look like?

There's a test program in `test/child.js` which intentionally blocks up for the
specified number of ms, you can run it like this:

```
% node test/child.js 1100
{"name":"dump-stacks","blockedMs":1042,"stack":"burnFor (/foo/test/child.js:18:5)\nmain (/foo/test/child.js:6:3)\n/foo/test/child.js:27:1\nModule._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1138:30)\n[..]run_main_module.js:17:47\n"}
{"name":"dump-stacks","blockedMs":1100,"stack":"burnFor (/foo/test/child.js:18:5)\nmain (/foo/test/child.js:10:3)\n"}
```

The default, without configuration, is to alert on blocks for more than a second
(1,000ms), which show up here. You can see the very raw javascript stacks; no
processing of sourcemaps is done, and no attempt is made to hide the node internals.
`async` stack traces are not processed, which means the second stack is shorter,
as it's after an `async` event.


## Usage

Load the module on start-up. It reads the environment, and starts immediately.

It writes json lines to `stderr`, in a format similar to
[`bunyan`](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan),
although without enough metadata for `bunyan` to actually process them.


## Configuration

 * `DUMP_STACKS_REPORT_ONCE_MS=1000`: If the loop is blocked for this number of
     milliseconds, print the stack.
 * `DUMP_STACKS_OBSERVE_MS=100`: Record details about the event loop about this
     often.
 * `DUMP_STACKS_CHECK_MS=100`: Check up on the event loop about this often.
 * `DUMP_STACKS_ENABLED=false`: Do Nothing At All; don't even execute the native module

The first value is up to you. Set it too low, and you will get a lot of reports,
and a report has some overhead. Set it too high and you won't get any reports.
One second is a *long* time.

The other values would need to be lowered if you want to see blocks shorter than
those values, at the expense of being less efficient (although probably not
measurably so!).


## How does it work?

As a native module, it can do things in C++ which are not affected by the
event loop, but can still observe the health of the event loop, and interact
with the javascript stack.

It performs functionality equivalent to the following JS, but there is no JS
involved; it is all in C++. This is a slight simplification, but surprisingly
close to the actual implementation.

We get the event loop to record when it was last alive:
```js
withTheMainEventLoop(() => {
  setInterval(() => {
    lastAlive = Date.now();
    wroteThisBlock = false;
  }, DUMP_STACKS_OBSERVE_MS);
});
```


We then have a worker thread which checks whether the event loop is wedged,
and respond by logging:
```js
inAnIndependentThread(async () => {
  for (;;) {
    await sleep(DUMP_STACKS_CHECK_MS);

    const loopBlockedMs = Date.now() - lastAlive;
    if (loopBlockedMs > DUMP_STACKS_REPORT_ONCE_MS && !wroteThisBlock) {
      logStack();
      wroteThisBlock = true;
    }
  }
});
```


## Future work
 
 * Benchmarks.
 * Report the stack continuously, as a form of low-overhead profiler.
 * Report a stack at the "end" of a long block, with the actual total block time.
 * Write stacks to a different destination, e.g. a webhook.
